# Web app

This is a playground for me, to test some networking stuff between services.

## TODO

- [ ] Update _id to be UNIX-style timestamp. This will allow for a different
  routing in at least one backend function.

## FIXME

- [ ] Some "bridges" use localhost, others the alias defined in the compose file.
