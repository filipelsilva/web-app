# Web app

This is a playground for me, to test some networking stuff between services.

## TODO

- [x] Do basic functionality
- [ ] Update _id to be UNIX-style timestamp (this will allow for a different
  routing in at least one backend function)
- [ ] Add authentication module
- [ ] Add other frameworks

## FIXME

- [ ] Some "bridges" use localhost, others the alias defined in the compose file
- [ ] Refactor some stuff, namely the frontend, to be cleaner
